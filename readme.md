## üí∞ Staking Plans

### Available Plans

| Plan | Duration | Minimum Credits | Total Reward | Daily Reward |
|------|----------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Quick Stake | 7 days | 50 | 100% (100 credits) | ~14.29 credits/day |
| Standard Stake | 30 days | 100 | 250% (350 credits) | ~11.67 credits/day |
| Premium Stake | 90 days | 500 | 500% (3000 credits) | ~33.33 credits/day |
| Elite Stake | 180 days | 1000 | 1000% (11000 credits) | ~61.11 credits/day |

### Reward Calculation

- **Total Reward**: Plan percentage √ó Staked amount
- **Daily Reward**: Total reward √∑ Plan duration
- **Final Credits**: Original stake + Total reward

## üîÑ User Flow

### 1. Registration & Wallet Setup
- User creates account
- System generates unique wallet address
- Wallet address displayed to user

### 2. Deposit Process
- User sends cryptocurrency to their wallet address
- System monitors and verifies deposit
- Credits equal to deposit amount are added to user account
- Funds automatically transferred to main wallet

### 3. Staking Process
- User selects available staking plan
- System validates sufficient credits
- Staking period begins immediately
- Daily rewards are distributed automatically

### 4. Reward Distribution
- Credits are added daily based on plan calculation
- Users can view accumulated rewards in real-time
- Withdrawal available only after staking period completion

### 5. Withdrawal Process
- User requests withdrawal after staking period ends
- Provides withdrawal address and amount
- System validates credit balance
- Cryptocurrency sent to specified address

## ü§ù Referral Program

### How It Works
- Each user receives unique referral link
- Referrer earns 10% of completed staking plan value
- Rewards credited as additional credits
- No limit on referral earnings

### Example
- User A refers User B
- User B stakes 1000 credits in Elite Plan
- User A receives 100 credits (10% of 1000) as referral reward

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Required Components

#### Backend Services
- **Wallet Generator**: Creates unique addresses for each user
- **Blockchain Monitor**: Tracks deposits and confirmations
- **Credit Manager**: Handles virtual currency operations

### Comprehensive End-to-End Testing Strategy

This section provides a complete testing methodology that covers every aspect of the crypto staking platform, from user registration to admin functions.

#### Phase 0: Setup - Testing Environment

**Prerequisites:**
- Postman Desktop App
- TronLink browser extension with test wallet
- Node.js server running (`node server.js`)
- MongoDB instance

**Environment Setup:**
1. **Clean Database State**
   ```bash
   mongosh
   db.users.deleteMany({})  # Clear all test data
   ```

2. **Postman Environment Variables**
   ```
   baseURL: http://localhost:5000
   aliceId: (populated during testing)
   aliceWallet: (populated during testing)
   aliceAuthToken: (populated during testing)
   bobId: (populated during testing)
   bobWallet: (populated during testing)
   bobAuthToken: (populated during testing)
   adminAuthToken: (populated during testing)
   personalWallet: (your TronLink address)
   ```

3. **Wallet Funding**
   - Personal wallet: 30+ TRX
   - Admin wallet: 15+ TRX (for withdrawal processing)

#### Phase 1: Complete User Lifecycle Testing

**Test User: Alice**

1. **Registration Test**
   ```http
   POST {{baseURL}}/register
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "username": "alice",
     "email": "alice@example.com",
     "password": "Password123!",
     "agreeToTerms": true
   }
   ```
   - Verify: 201 status, unique wallet address generated
   - Save: userId and walletAddress to environment

2. **Authentication Test**
   ```http
   POST {{baseURL}}/login
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "identifier": "alice@example.com",
     "password": "Password123!"
   }
   ```
   - Verify: 200 status, JWT token returned
   - Save: authToken to environment

3. **Deposit & Auto-Sweep Test**
   - Send 10 TRX to Alice's wallet via TronLink
   - Monitor server logs for automated deposit detection:
     ```
     üîç Running deposit check...
     üí∞ Deposit of 10 TRX found for user alice.
     üßπ Swept 9.9 TRX from alice to admin. Tx: <hash>
     ```
   - Verify: User credits = 10 via profile endpoint

4. **Staking Test**
   ```http
   POST {{baseURL}}/api/staking/plan
   Authorization: Bearer {{aliceAuthToken}}
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "planId": "quick",
     "amount": 5
   }
   ```
   - Verify: Credits deducted, stake recorded
   - Check: Profile shows remaining credits = 5

5. **Transaction History Test**
   ```http
   GET {{baseURL}}/api/history
   Authorization: Bearer {{aliceAuthToken}}
   ```
   - Verify: Deposit (+10) and stake (-5) entries present

6. **Withdrawal Test**
   ```http
   POST {{baseURL}}/api/withdrawal/request
   Authorization: Bearer {{aliceAuthToken}}
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "withdrawalAddress": "{{personalWallet}}",
     "amount": 2
   }
   ```
   - Verify: 200 status, txHash returned
   - Check: TronLink wallet receives 2 TRX
   - Confirm: User credits reduced to 3

7. **KYC Upload Test**
   ```http
   POST {{baseURL}}/api/kyc/upload
   Authorization: Bearer {{aliceAuthToken}}
   Content-Type: multipart/form-data
   
   id_front: [image file]
   selfie: [image file]
   ```
   - Verify: KYC status set to "pending"

#### Phase 2: Referral System Testing

**Test Users: Alice (referrer) & Bob (referee)**

1. **Get Referral Code**
   ```http
   GET {{baseURL}}/api/referral/code
   Authorization: Bearer {{aliceAuthToken}}
   ```

2. **Register with Referral**
   ```http
   POST {{baseURL}}/register
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "username": "bob",
     "email": "bob@example.com",
     "password": "Password123!",
     "agreeToTerms": true,
     "referralCode": "<ALICE_REFERRAL_CODE>"
   }
   ```

3. **Fund & Stake as Bob**
   - Deposit 55 TRX to Bob's wallet
   - Stake 50 credits in quick plan
   - Verify: Bob's stake is active

4. **Simulate Referral Payout**
   - Database: Mark Bob's stake as "completed"
   - Temporarily adjust cron schedule for testing
   - Verify: Alice receives 5 credits referral bonus

#### Phase 3: Admin Function Testing

1. **Promote User to Admin**
   ```bash
   db.users.updateOne({username: "alice"}, {$set: {isAdmin: true}})
   ```

2. **Admin Authentication**
   - Login as Alice again to get admin-privileged token

3. **Admin Endpoints Testing**
   ```http
   GET {{baseURL}}/api/admin/stats
   GET {{baseURL}}/api/admin/users
   GET {{baseURL}}/api/admin/kyc/pending
   POST {{baseURL}}/api/admin/kyc/{{aliceId}}/approve
   POST {{baseURL}}/api/admin/users/{{bobId}}/credits
   ```
